# Network Studies - Creating a Sockets Client

Project written in Python using the Sockets library, created for my studies of TCP and UDP connections, among other network connections and communications. Its main objective is to create communication between the client and the local server remotely. It will also make it easier to create a reverse shell with the target of the connection.

### Main features: 

> TCP connection <br>
> UDP connection <br>
> A server to check the current requested connection

Project in progress. New features will be added over time
